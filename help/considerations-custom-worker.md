# Considerations when creating and using custom worker {#considerations-custom-worker}

## Prerequisites and provisioning requirements {#provisioning}

**TBD:**

* What all accesses and licenses are required?
* What all permissions are required to create, debug, and deploy custom workers?
* How do developers get access and provision the required apps?
* Repository management

## Other considerations {#others}

**TBD**:

* Security?
* Custom worker SLA is dependent on SLAs of various services it depends on.
* How do devs know KPIs of their custom?
