# Best practices and troubleshooting {#best-practices}

Any best practices for developers:

* Any items to take care of when creating projects.
* Any naming conventions, reserved keywords, etc.?
* Any terms that can become a source of confusion later based on our OOTB naming.

Possible troubleshooting steps:

* APIs are not added to the Adobe I/O project.
* File permissions issues on the local file system.
* Indentation of YAML file is incorrect. Link to the sample YAML file.
* When setting the Journal for the first time, it may fail with a 500 error code. Re-run the Journal setup to complete the setup.
