# Best practices and troubleshooting {#best-practices}

**TBD**:

Add any best practices for developers in this section:

* Any items to take care of when creating projects.
* Any naming conventions, reserved keywords, etc.?
* Any terms that can become a source of confusion later based on our OOTB naming.

**TBD**:

Add possible troubleshooting steps to this section:

* APIs are not added to the Adobe I/O project.
* File permissions issues on the local file system.
* Indentation of YAML file is incorrect. Link to the sample YAML file.
* When setting the Journal for the first time, it may fail with a 500 error code. Re-run the Journal setup to complete the setup.

## Use custom application in Experience Manager {#use-in-aem}

**TBD:**

* Best practices around using processing profiles and workers.
* Scenarios or use cases examples of usage.
* If both approaches are possible, what are the parameters to look into and diligence to do so that developers can pick the best approach?
