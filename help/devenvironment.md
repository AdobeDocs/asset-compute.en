# Set developer environment {#set-environment}

**TBD**:

* Leverage Firefly's environment setup instructions. https://github.com/AdobeDocs/project-firefly/blob/master/getting_started/setup.md

* What additional steps are required for Asset Compute Service?

* See the [prerequisites](introduction.md#prerequisites).

* What to cross-check and how? Say, prerequisites, connection status, latest build, correct roles and permissions, etc.

* Any steps in the beginning that lead to gotchas later should be called out for caution? For example,
  * don't change some defaults initially
  * know risks when deviating from standard path
  * naming conventions to follow
  * Retrieve and format credentials (YAML file details)
