# Contribute {#contribute}

Asset Compute Service extensibility is developed under an open development model on [github.com/adobe](https://github.com/adobe) that welcomes contributions from extension developers. All components relevant to developing, building and testing custom workers are open source. A few ways in which you can contribute are:

* Share feedback: If you see a product or documentation issue or have a new feature idea or improvement request, create a GitHub issue in the relevant repository. 

  _If you are not sure which repository to submit your issue, log an issue in [Asset Compute SDK repository](https://github.com/adobe/asset-compute-sdk)._
* Patch: To provide a patch, fork and provide a pull request.

For detailed guidelines, see the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/adobe/asset-compute-sdk/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
