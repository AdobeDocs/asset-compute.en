# Overview of Asset Compute Service {#overview}

Project Firefly is a framework to build and deploy custom web applications on Adobe I/O Runtime. Developers can leverage React Spectrum (Adobeâ€™s UI toolkit), create microservices, create custom events, and orchestrate APIs to create custom apps for business users.

Asset Compute is a scalable, lightweight, and extensible platform service to process assets for AEM. The service works completely on the Adobe I/O runtime. It is easily extendable by creating custom workers based off Project Firefly. These custom workers are Project Firefly apps and can be written to do tasks such as add custom conversion tools, or call external APIs to perform image operations.

See [documentation of Project Firefly](https://www.adobe.io/apis/experienceplatform/project-firefly/docs.html).
